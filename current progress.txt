so far I have:
created an entry in httpRequests[] for the enviromental sensors
initialized the entry in httpRequest with internal and external BME readings
created a call back function for the HTTP request
created a readBME function

the call back function and the readBME function contain essentially nothing
I need to create global variables which store the values for each sensor reading
Eventually i will need a way to seperate the inside and outside readings for the BME, 

I will likely also need to create a seperate task for the ccs811,
				 as it has a specific setup, and prep time
				 
then the oxygen sensor will need calibrated/ tuned, we will need to find a way to true up the 
	value, but once there it should be accurate
then the relays will 

 Ive created:
 BME280_RawData *bmeDatIn;
BME280_RawData *bmeDatOut;
BME280Reading(void)
enum EnviroIdx, 
	whic contains the indexes of each variable
    EnviroIdx_InTemp,
    EnviroIdx_OutTemp,
    EnviroIdx_InHumid,
    EnviroIdx_OutHumid,
    EnviroIdx_InPres,
    EnviroIdx_OutPres,
    EnviroIdx_MaxEnviro,
    
Int32 tempIn;
Uint32 presIn;
Uint32 humidIn;
Int32 tempOut;
Uint32 presOut;
Uint32 humidOut;
